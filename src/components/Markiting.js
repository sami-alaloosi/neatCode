            Simply trying to memorize solutions is an oversimplification of the coding interview prep process, at NeatCode we believe that memorizing solutions is a waste of your time. We created a way for you to keep notes of all the important patterns and algorithms such that you will never forget a pattern not a solution to a specific question. Learning the importance of patterns is the difference between solving one question by memorizing its solution or learning the underlying pattern and being able to solve dozens of variants of that question we want to help you ace the coding interview patterns, for that reason we believe in note taking, thatâ€™s why we gave you the user the option to keep a note log of all the questions and the pattern that they teach you, you will never need to memorize solutions ever again!
